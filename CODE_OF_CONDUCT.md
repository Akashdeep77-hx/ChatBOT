CODE OF CONDUCT

1. Purpose

Chatbot aims to be welcoming and inclusive to a wide range of contributors from diverse backgrounds. We strive to offer a friendly, safe, and inviting environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for all participants and the actions that will be taken in response to unacceptable behavior.

We encourage everyone involved in Chatbot to contribute to a positive and safe experience for all.

2. Open Source Citizenship

This Code of Conduct also seeks to enhance open-source involvement by highlighting the importance of recognizing and improving the impact of our actions on the community.

Communities reflect the societies they are part of, and positive actions are crucial to address various forms of inequality and power abuses.

If you notice someone making extra efforts to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment, please let us know.

3. Expected Behavior

All community members are expected to:

- Engage authentically and actively to support the health and longevity of the community.
- Show consideration and respect in their interactions.
- Seek collaboration before resorting to conflict.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and language.
- Be aware of your surroundings and fellow participants. Report any dangerous situations, distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem minor.
- Respect all individuals at community event venues, which may be shared with the public.

4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are not tolerated:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language against others.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or discriminatory jokes and language.
- Sharing sexually explicit or violent content.
- Revealing or threatening to reveal others' personal information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome physical contact; obtain consent before touching others.
- Unwanted sexual attention, including sexual comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, or advances.
- Intimidation, stalking, or following, whether online or in person.
- Encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- Disrupting community events, including talks and presentations.

5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and decision-makers, will not be tolerated.

Those asked to cease unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Community organizers may take appropriate actions, including temporary bans or permanent expulsion from the community, without prior warning (and without a refund for paid events).

6. Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have concerns, please contact a community organizer promptly at akashdeepchikbaraik01@gmail.com.

Organizers are available to assist with contacting local law enforcement or providing support to those feeling unsafe. In-person events may also offer escorts for those in distress.

 7. Addressing Grievances

If you believe you have been wrongly or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, notify Ahmadfaizalbh with a clear description of your grievance. It will be addressed according to our existing policies.

8. Scope

All participants (contributors, sponsors, and other guests) must follow this Code of Conduct in all community venues—both online and offline—and in any one-on-one interactions related to community matters.

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside community activities if it affects the safety and well-being of community members.
